## Business Context
- Airbnb has transformed the way people travel since its establishment in 2008, providing guests and hosts with unique and personalized travel experiences. Over the years, Airbnb has become a one-of-a-kind service that is widely used and recognized around the world.

The dataset under consideration contains approximately 49,000 observations in total, with 16 columns comprising a mix of categorical and numerical values. By exploring and analyzing this dataset, key insights and understandings can be obtained.
